# ZombiesGalore
A simple yet challenging game


## How to play:
You will spawn immediately. Ghosts will start rapidly approaching you, so 
make sure to defend yourself to the death! Shoot a ghost twice and it will die,
stabbing it will kill it instantly. But if its close enough to be stabbed, you might be in trouble
too: Ghosts will deal one damage every 2 seconds, so get rid of them quickly!

Stabbing has a much longer cooldown than shooting, but also deals more damage.

Shooting has a shorter cooldown but deals less damage.

On death, ghosts have a chance of dropping one heart or three ammo.
